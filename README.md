# Quiz-Manager-Web-App
A Quiz Manager Web Application built with PHP, MYSQL and JavaScript.

This project was built during my apprenticeship and went towards my final grade. A brief was supplied, I then had to come up with a solution to meet the requirements. 

In short, the application will be used to manage and view quizzes and their associated questions / answers. Three levels of user access allow different users to perform different actions:

1. Edit Permissions - This user can create, edit and delete quizzes, questions and answers.


2. View Permissions - This user can only view the quizzes, questions and answers. 


3. Restricted Permissions - This user can only view questions. 



SET UP
  1. Add the files to a new directory.
  2. Import the SQL.
  3. Connect to the DB in the config file.
  4. Load the config file and check for error output.
  5.If no errors are outputted the Quiz Manager can now be used.
